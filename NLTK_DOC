What is Nltk?
-------------
The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a platform used for building Python programs that work with human language data for applying in statistical natural language processing (NLP).
The Natural Language Toolkit is an open source library for the Python programming language originally written by Steven Bird, Edward Loper and Ewan Klein for use in development and education.

Features of Nltk
----------------
-Tokenization
-Stemming
-Prediction
-Stop words
-Speech Tagging
-Sentiment Analysis

Tokenization
------------
A sentence or data can be split into words using the method word_tokenize().
The same principle can be applied to sentences. Simply change the to sent_tokenize().

Stemming
--------
A word stem is part of a word. It is sort of a normalization idea, but linguistic.
For example, the stem of the word waiting is wait.

Prediction
----------
We can use natural language processing to make predictions.
Example: Given a product review, a computer can predict if its positive or negative based on the text.
To create our analysis program, we have several steps:
-Data preparation
-Feature extraction
-Training
-Prediction

Stop words
----------
Text may contain stop words like ‘the’, ‘is’, ‘are’. Stop words can be filtered from the text to be processed.The nltk module contains a list of stop words.

Speech Tagging
--------------
The module NLTK can automatically tag speech.
Given a sentence or paragraph, it can label words such as verbs, nouns and so on.

Sentiment Analysis
------------------
Given a movie review or a tweet, it can be automatically classified in categories.
These categories can be user defined (positive, negative) or whichever classes you want.
Classification is done using several steps: training and prediction.
The training phase needs to have training data, this is example data in which we define examples. The classifier will use the training data to make predictions.

Summary
-------
NLTK or Natural Language Toolkit is a platform used for building Python programs that work with human language data for applying in statistical natural language processing (NLP).
NLTK provides features such as Tokenization, Stemming, Prediction, Stop words, Speech Tagging, Sentimental Analysis.
